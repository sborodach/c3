Project Proposal:
A brief description of the project you want to do and why you are interested in.
What problem are you solving?
Include exactly what your data is (features, number of observations ect) and what you are going to try to predict.  If supervised what is your target?
What are the next steps you need to take?
NBA Win-Share Estimator Example:
High level description of project.
I want to predict the effectiveness of NBA players--especially those coming off their Rookie contracts. More specifically, I want to analyze season-based stats and game-specific stats to get an objective prediction of how young NBA players will fare when during their first "big" (i.e., non-Rookie) contract.
  2. What question or problem are you trying to solve?
Because Rookie contracts are set by the NBA's collective bargaining agreement ("CBA"), the first time any NBA executive has to make a "real" contract decision for the rookie is after the expiration of the Rookie contract. That can lead to drastically over paying Rookies based on perceived skill or potential--versus what the Rookie actually provides to the team (e.g., portions of wins accountable to the Rookie's performance). I hope to help provide an objective guidepost for the player's salary.
     3. What are your data sources?
I will get my data from Basketball-Reference.com. I am hoping to use the previous years stats of the player.  Stats like shooting percent, rebounds, scoring ect. I am hoping to also use some advanced stats from ESPN like offensive win share.  My target will be either what their second contract was for (showing if they got better) or their Win Share percentage 2 years out.
I expect to have over 4000 data points (that is how many people have played in the NBA.  I expect that not all of them fall into the rookie structure or made it passed their rookie contracts but I expect to still have several thousand observations (with several years each of data)
      4. Whatâ€™s your next step towards making this your project?
I need to pull the available data from Basketball-Reference.com.
